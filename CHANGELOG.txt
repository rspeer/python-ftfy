## Version 3.0.5 (November 1, 2013)

- Fix the arguments to `fix_file`, because they were totally wrong.

## Version 3.0.4 (October 1, 2013)

- Restore compatibility with Python 2.6.

## Version 3.0.3 (September 9, 2013)

- Fixed an ugly regular expression bug that prevented ftfy from importing on a
  narrow build of Python.

## Version 3.0.2 (September 4, 2013)

- Fixed some false positives.
  - Basically, 3.0.1 was too eager to treat text as MacRoman or cp437 when
    three consecutive characters coincidentally decoded as UTF-8. Increased the
    cost of those encodings so that they have to successfully decode multiple
    UTF-8 characters.
  - See tests/test_real_tweets.py for the new test cases that were added as a
    result.

## Version 3.0.1 (August 30, 2013)

- Fix bug in `fix_java_encoding` that led to only the first instance of
  CESU-8 badness per line being fixed
- Add a fixer that removes unassigned characters that can break Python 3.3
  (http://bugs.python.org/issue18183)

## Version 3.0 (August 26, 2013)

- Generally runs faster
- Idempotent
- Simplified decoding logic
- Understands more encodings and more kinds of mistakes
- Takes options that enable or disable particular normalization steps
- Long line handling: now the time-consuming step (fix_text_encoding) will be
  consistently skipped on long lines, but all other fixes will apply
- Tested on millions of examples from Twitter, ensuring a near-zero rate of
  false positives

## Version 2.0.2 (June 20, 2013)

- Fix breaking up of long lines, so it can't go into an infinite loop

## Version 2.0.1 (March 19, 2013)

- Restored Python 2.6 support

## Version 2.0 (January 30, 2013)

- Python 3 support
- Use fast Python built-ins to speed up fixes
- Bugfixes

## Version 1.0 (August 24, 2012)

- Made into its own package with no dependencies, instead of a part of
  `metanl`
